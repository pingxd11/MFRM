Data:
-------
1. There are two datasets which are recorded by two folder:BJ_datasets and CA_datasets.<br>
2.The specific data file includes the following contents:<br>
	gen_edges:road network data.CA contains 21,693 bidirectional edges and 21,047 vertices.BJ consists of 433,391 				unidirectional edges and 171,504 vertices.<br>
	gen_cands_*:candidates location data.<br>
	gen_avg_reflocs_*:uniform distribution of reference locations data.
	gen_rand_reflocs_* :random distribution of reference locations data.
	real_reflocs:real users'reference locations data.The real users data of BJ is available from [33]in paper. There are 136,686 		sample points for each user on average. For CA, we use the discrete user check-in data[8] in paper.The average number of check-		ins for a user is about 125 after excluding users with less than 20 check-ins.The presence probabilities for reference 			locations of each user are skewed,where the differences between the maximum and minimum presence probabilities are 0.278 (CA) 		and 0.367 (BJ) on average.
	800_fac_xy:facility location data with coordinate
	800_fac:facility location data without coordinate
	The edges file format is "edge_id vs_id ve_id dist". 
	The facilities file format is "fac_id vs_id ve_id dist_vs_fac dist_fac_ve" or "fac_id vs_id ve_id dist_vs_fac dist_fac_ve lon 		lat".                          
	The candidates file format is "cand_id vs_id ve_id dist_vs_cand dist_cand_ve lon lat".
	The reference locations file format is "refloc_id vs_id ve_id dist_vs_refloc dist_refloc_ve prob lon lat".
Usage:<br>
-------
1.The program must be run in the specified directory:D:\Experiment\MFRMT
2. parameter setting: <br>
	Implements of all algorithoms: ...\config_CA.txt ...\gen_config.txt ...\cov_config.txt real_config.txt<br>
	Calculate for comparing with min-dist FR problems:first step:-md ...\config_MD.txt second 						step:-mdr ...\config_MD.txt<br>
3.In the configuration file,1 means execute and 0 means not execute,it can be modified according to the experimental requirements.<br>
